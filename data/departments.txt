The mechanical engineering department awarded more than 140 Ph.D degrees. At present there are 25 candidates pursuing their Ph.D. The teaching faculty has engaged in a number of R & D projects sponsored by UGC, AICTE, MHRD, AR&DB, ADA, Naval Research Board, etc. Presently, 16 full time faculty are serving the institute. There are 12 Professors, 4 Associate Professors. The department has set Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Time bound (SMART) objectives in achieving academic excellence in UG, PG, M.Sc. (Engineering) by offering Research and Doctoral programmes at par with IITs and National Institutes of Excellence. It has also set an objective to evolve itself as an R & D centre to promote and pursue research in the areas of current industrial and all other relevant thrust areas in Engineering.

2.Civil engineering
The Department of Civil Engineering was established in 1917.
The Department of Civil Engineering was started in the year 1917 off ering B.E. course in Civil Engineering and has been accredited by AICTE New Delhi. The department was functioning in the city campus of Bangalore University at K R Circle until 1974 and was later shifted to Jnana Bharathi Campus. The department has a built-up area of 8800 sq.m. The Department offered under graduate courses (B.E.) in Civil Engineering till 1960 and later started PG courses (M E in Structural Engineering and Geo-technical Engineering) and now the department offers PG courses in eight different fields of specialization. It is one of the Quality Improvement Programme Departments of the MHRD offering admissions to M.E. and PhD programmes for the teachers drawn from AICTE approved engineering colleges.

While the primary task of the faculty is to produce efficient man power in Civil Engineering to meet the rapidly changing needs of the society, it also strives to achieve eminence in focused areas of research and to realize the economic potential of its R&D capabilities. A nurturing environment has been created to encourage the social, cultural, physical and intellectual developments of the students as well as to sharpen their leadership qualities and interpersonal skills. The alumni of the department have occupied key positions both in India and abroad bringing laurels to their alma mater. The UG curriculum strikes a balance between engineering fundamentals and applications and thereby preparing graduates for both research and professional practice in the Civil Engineering disciplines. From the year 1998, the department has got the academic autonomy and the syllabus of the UG course designed to meet the requirements of the industrial demand with the orientation towards CAD. Introduction to CAD, applications in Civil Engineering, regular technical visits, project tours and design project works are the features of the course contents. The department offers Ph.D. degree programmes in all the major fields of specialization in Civil Engineering and also offers two years research programme encompassing the degree of M.Sc Engineering by Research.
