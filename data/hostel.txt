HOSTEL
The College provides hostel facilities for boys and girls separately both in the Jnana Bharathi and City Campus. Residing in Hostels gives a distinct advantage of befriending with students from various parts of the country and expose them different religions, languages and customs. Additionally, living as a community in the hostel will lead to all-round development of personality of a hostelite and will definitely go a long way in fostering good citizens.
